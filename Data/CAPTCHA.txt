About Dataset
Context

This dataset contains CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) images. Built in 1997 as way for users to identify and block bots (in order to prevent spam, DDOS etc.). They have since then been replace by reCAPTCHA because they are breakable using Artificial Intelligence (as I encourage you to do).
Content

The images are 5 letter words that can contain numbers. The images have had noise applied to them (blur and a line). They are 200 x 50 PNGs.
